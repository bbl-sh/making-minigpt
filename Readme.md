# GPT Implementation from Scratch

This repository contains my implementation of GPT from scratch using PyTorch, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's series on building GPT.

## Objectives

* Understand the fundamental components of GPT.
* Implement each module step-by-step using PyTorch.
* Develop a working GPT model capable of basic text generation.

## Progress

* [ ] Data processing and tokenization
* [ ] Transformer architecture implementation
* [ ] Training loop and optimization
* [ ] Testing and text generation
* [ ] Classification using models
* [ ] Fine-tuning using opensource-llms
